I am a trained mathematician, currently exploring applications of geometry and topology to data science problems. In my past professional life, I was a postdoc in the mathematics department at the University of Notre Dame. My research work focused on Riemannian geometry and differential topology. My current interests are in statistical inference and neural networks, both theory as well as real-world applications.
