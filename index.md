I am a trained mathematician, currently exploring applications of geometry and topology to data science problems. In my past professional life, I was a postdoc in the mathematics department at the University of Notre Dame. My research work focused on Riemannian geometry and differential topology. You can find a list of publications [here](https://sites.google.com/site/priyankarrajangeometry/home). 

My current interests are in statistical inference and neural networks, both theory as well as real-world applications. Please checkout my [github page](https://github.com/priyanka1rajan/zero-shot-classifier-application) for some interesting projects on computer vision applications leveraging recent work in the space of zero-shot learning.
